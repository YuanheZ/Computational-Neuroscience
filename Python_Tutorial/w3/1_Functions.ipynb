This is known as iteration. Put a print statement in the `for loop` to print the values of `x`. Run your code. You should see that `x` decreases towards zero. Now set `mu=2.5`. You should find that `x` goes towards 0.6 (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map#Behavior_dependent_on_r).)

Think about how you can do this with if statements. Finally, try different values of `mu`. The Wikipedia page explains what you should observe for different values of `mu`."
